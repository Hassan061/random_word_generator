## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
tkinter==8.6
random-word==1.0.7
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
No third-party packages required in other languages.
"""
```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No APIs are used in this project.
"""
```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "This is the main entry of the program. It should create an instance of WordGenerator and GUI."),
    ("word_generator.py", "This file should implement the WordGenerator class. It should have methods to start and stop word generation and a method to generate a new random word."),
    ("gui.py", "This file should implement the GUI class. It should have methods to start and stop word generation and a method to update the word on the GUI.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "word_generator.py",
    "gui.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'random-word' package is used to generate random English words. 
The 'tkinter' package is used to create the GUI for the application. 
The 'threading' library is used to create a new thread for the word generation.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. The main entry of the program is 'main.py'. The 'random-word' and 'tkinter' packages need to be installed before running the program.
